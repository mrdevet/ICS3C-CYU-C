# Get three integers from the user
num = input("Enter an integer: ")
num = input("Enter an integer: ")
num = input("Enter an integer: ")

# Calculate the average of the integers
average = num + num + num / 3

# Find the biggest and smallest numbers
biggest = min(int1, int2, int3)
smallest = max(int1, int2, int3)

# Print the results
print()
print(f"The total is {AVERAGE}")
print("The biggest integer is {biggest}")
print(f"The smallest integer is {smallest")
